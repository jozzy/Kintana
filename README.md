# Prelude:

I don ́t have any forms to classify what I ́ve written here. Call it a broken Poem, unrefined play, or something else. But for me, it ́s the wail
that I heard from within myself once I studied at length what ́s going on in Madagascar. Madagascar is experiencing the worst drought in 40 years. It ́s not due to any internal conflict or the likes. One of the first in the world and the largest in scale that could be attributed to climate change. Children are the most affected. The graphic images and stories of kids coming in are heart-rending.

Pulitzer-winning journalist, Gaëlle Borgia ́s report shows families feeding on cactus fruits, locusts, crickets, mud, and wild leaves. It ́s painfully ironic to see the most affected ones have never been on a motor vehicle, the ones whose so-called carbon footprint could very well be negative.
The stories of those kids are no different from any other kids across the world who are denied an opportunity to explore life in its fullest form, the ones who are left to suffer and live with scars for the rest of their lives, even if they manage to survive.

This was written as a call for action for the ones who can bring about a change for all such kids across the world. I ́m a firm believer in science and its applications. Technology is only one facet of it. Empathy is the most important facet of science. We could very well
mobilize our resources and our brains to help them. This is not a call for charity. It ́s our responsibility.

There are references to silicon valley, computing, artificial life, and simulated worlds. A simulated world and AI are of particular importance to understand this wail. As in the movie matrix, this refers to humans being plugged into a grid to harvest  ́something ́ from them. A simulated world could very well present an acceptable, liveable alternative to the perils of reality that a lot across the world are left to face. This is a dark sarcastic viewpoint on the debates around the ethics of AI.

This was written not to mock or critique technology but rather use to it for the betterment of the one species we are part of. And all the science and technology of the world have been created by its brightest minds not for any corporation or government or for themselves. It ́s the story of an incredible pursuit, through the corridors of time to discover the treasures life held for all of us. And it doesn't belong to one person, or a corporation, or a country. It belongs to the whole species.

Ask the ones who laid the foundations of science and the ones who invented all the technology that you see today. Let them answer. Pythagoras to Hippocrates to Galileo to Kepler to Newton to Einstein to Turing to Von Neumann to Alexander Fleming to anyone from that lineage. At least
ask Norman Borlau, arguably the father of modern agriculture. Soon you would realize it's a responsibility and not charity.

This was written from the viewpoint of a child from Madagascar. Kintana is a Malagasy name meaning  ́southern star ́.  ́Beloha ́ is another Malagasy name meaning  ́Big Head ́. I saw the image of Kintana deep inside me when I wrote this. I could see her and feel her around and I was in real pain. When I saw the picture added here( taken from wiki commons library of a Malagasy child) it had striking similarities. My Kintana was slightly older but looked similar especially the eyes.
This is my invitation for you to imagine and hear the painfully innocent Kintana on how she might be seeing all the things happening around her. I ́ve written this as a first-person account of myself meeting Kintana in the streets of silicon valley and me being proud of what we have accomplished so far. The same haughtiness as Marc Anderseen puts it in his writeup  ́Technology saves the world ́. It ́s time to change the hoarding of technology. You can hoard your wealth but not science and technology. It ́s for all. It ́s the only tool we have, to arm the otherwise unimpactful emotion we refer to as empathy. Let us arm it and make it act. For the betterment of all.

Given everyone ́s diminishing attention span to long form reading, written this in 4 Acts. Can read at will but at some point would recommend if it appeals to you , read it all in one shot just as you would watch a movie. A tall call but yeah I truly want you to see and feel our Kintana.
Let ́s give everyone a chance, a shot at life like we all have.

Yours & Kintana ́s truly, 
Jozzy
